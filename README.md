## Configuration (Optional)

## Usage
To retrieve exchange rates, use the `ExchangeRateServiceInterface`:

```php
use BrightCreations\MoneyConverter\Contracts\ExchangeRateServiceInterface;

// get exchange rates of USD with all other currencies as a laravel collection
$exchangeRates = $service->getExchangeRates('USD');
```

You can inject the service into a constructor or resolve it using the `resolve` or `app->make` method. Here are examples of each approach:

### Constructor Injection

```php
use BrightCreations\MoneyConverter\Contracts\ExchangeRateServiceInterface;

class SomeClass {
    private $exchangeRateService;

    public function __construct(ExchangeRateServiceInterface $exchangeRateService) {
        $this->exchangeRateService = $exchangeRateService;
    }

    public function someMethod() {
        $exchangeRates = $this->exchangeRateService->getExchangeRates('USD');
        // Use $exchangeRates...
    }
}
```

### Using `resolve` Method

```php
use BrightCreations\MoneyConverter\Contracts\ExchangeRateServiceInterface;

$exchangeRateService = resolve(ExchangeRateServiceInterface::class);
$exchangeRates = $exchangeRateService->getExchangeRates('USD');
// Use $exchangeRates...
```

### Using `app->make` Method

```php
use BrightCreations\MoneyConverter\Contracts\ExchangeRateServiceInterface;

$exchangeRateService = app()->make(ExchangeRateServiceInterface::class);
$exchangeRates = $exchangeRateService->getExchangeRates('USD');
// Use $exchangeRates...
```
